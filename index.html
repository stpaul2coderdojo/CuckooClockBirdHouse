<p>"The cuckoos are an extremely diverse group of birds with regards to breeding systems.<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_4-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo#cite_note-HBW-4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;The majority of species are&nbsp;<a title="Monogamy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy">monogamous</a>, but there are exceptions. The anis and the guira cuckoo lay their eggs in communal nests, which is built by all members of the group. Incubation, brooding and territorial defence duties are shared by all members of the group. Within these species the anis breed as groups of monogamous pairs, but the guira cuckoos are not monogamous within the group, exhibiting a polygynandrous breeding system. This group nesting behaviour is not completely cooperative; females compete and may remove others' eggs when laying hers. Eggs are usually only ejected early in the breeding season in the anis, but can be ejected at any time by guria cuckoos.<sup id="cite_ref-Anis_18-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo#cite_note-Anis-18">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;<a title="Polyandry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry">Polyandry</a>&nbsp;has been confirmed in the&nbsp;<a title="Black coucal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_coucal">African black coucal</a>&nbsp;and is suspected to occur in the other coucals, perhaps explaining the reversed sexual dimorphism in the group.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The majority of cuckoo species, including malkohas, couas, coucals, and roadrunners and most other American cuckoos, build their own nests, although a large minority engage in&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Brood parasitism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasitism">brood parasitism</a>&nbsp;(see below). Most of these species nest in trees or bushes, but the coucals lay their eggs in nests on the ground or in low shrubs. Though on some occasions non-parasitic cuckoos parasitize other species, the parent still helps feed the chick.</p>
<p>The nests of cuckoos vary in the same way as the breeding systems. The nests of malkohas and Asian ground cuckoos are shallow platforms of twigs, but those of coucals are globular or domed nests of grasses. The New World cuckoos build saucers or bowls in the case of the New World ground cuckoos."<sup id="cite_ref-HBW_4-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo#cite_note-HBW-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Non-parasitic cuckoos, like most other non-passerines, lay white eggs, but many of the parasitic species lay coloured eggs to match those of their&nbsp;<a title="Passerine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine">passerine</a>&nbsp;hosts.</p>
<p>The young of all species are&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Altricial" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial">altricial</a>. Non-parasitic cuckoos leave the nest before they can fly, and some New World species have the shortest incubation periods among birds.<sup id="cite_ref-Payne_20-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo#cite_note-Payne-20">[20]</a></sup></p>
